        <h2>HISTORY of COOKIES</h2>
        <p>
            A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour,
            sugar and some type of oil or fat. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate
            chips, nuts, etc. In most English-speaking countries except for the United States and Canada, crisp cookies
            are called biscuits.

            Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the United Kingdom.[2] Some cookies
            may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars. Cookies or biscuits may be mass-produced in
            factories,made in small bakeries or homemade. Biscuit or cookie variants include sandwich biscuits, such as
            custard
            creams, Jammie Dodgers, Bourbons and Oreos, with marshmallow or jam filling and sometimes dipped in
            chocolate or another sweet coating. Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea.
            Factory-made cookies are sold in grocery stores, convenience stores and vending machines. Fresh-baked
            cookies are sold at bakeries and coffeehouses, with the latter ranging from small business-sized
            establishments to multinational corporations such as Starbucks.
